# Insurance-Fraud-Claim-ML-Prediction
In the insurance industry, claims related to fraud is a huge problem. As an insurance company, it can be quite complex and difficult to identify those unwanted claims.

In this project, I am working with data provided by an Automobile Insurance company. I am tasked with creating a predictive model, using the data provided, to predict if an insurance claim is considered fraudulent or not. The task is a classification task of Yes/No (i.e. Yes is Fraudulent, No is Not Fraudulent claim).   

The concluding result is that XGBoost Algorithm with Hyperparameter Optimizing achieved an 82% accuracy with 18% misclassification of fraudulent transactions.
